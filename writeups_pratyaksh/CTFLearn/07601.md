Ahh yes, a forensics challenge, always love to solve such problems. 

A digital forensics basically refers to the analysis, investigation and go through of the data found.

So, let us first look at the given problem.

So, as this is a forensics challenge let us first examine the metadata of this image.

we do that by using the Linux command line tool *exiftool*.

'exiftool AGT.png'
