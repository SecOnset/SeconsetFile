Ahh yes, a forensics challenge, always love to solve such problems. 

A digital forensics basically refers to the analysis, investigation and go through of the data found.

So, let us first look at the given problem.

[Link to the mega resource](https://mega.nz/#!CXYXBQAK!6eLJSXvAfGnemqWpNbLQtOHBvtkCzA7-zycVjhHPYQQ)


After visiting the mega link, we get a png image named AGT.png

So, as this is a forensics challenge let us first examine the metadata of this image.

we do that by using the Linux command line tool *exiftool*.

`exiftool AGT.png`

Hmm, nothing interesting here. Anyways moving further on we will have a look on another tool called **binwalk.**

We use this in the Linux CLI as `binwalk -e --dd=".*" AGT.png`

Breaking down the command
* `-e`: is the flag for binwalk that stands for extract. Automatically extract known file types
* `--dd`:  Extract <type> signatures, give the files an extension of <ext>, and execute <cmd>
  
  Let us see what we get.

We are given a folder that is extracted after the binwalk command is executed. Also,while the extraction, we keep seeing the same folders namely, "Secret Stuff", "Don't open This" and "I Warned You.jpeg".

Let us dive into those folders.

We use the `cd` command to do it.

Let us examine this image with "exiftool" command.

Again, nothing here too, let us examine the strings of the image.


Use the command `strings`


* `string I\ Warned\ You.jpeg` 

Voila, scrolling through the strings of the image, you can find the flag here.
